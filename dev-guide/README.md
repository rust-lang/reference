# The Rust Reference Developer Guide

This is the source of the Reference Developer Guide, published at <https://rust-lang.github.io/reference/dev-guide/>. It is written in Markdown using [mdbook]. If you are editing these pages, the best way to view them is to run `mdbook serve --open`. This will start a web server on localhost that you can visit to view the book; it will automatically reload each time you edit a page.

This is published via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages.
