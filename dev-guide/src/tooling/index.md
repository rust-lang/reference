# Reference tooling

The Reference uses [mdBook] to convert its source files from Markdown to HTML. See [Building the Reference] for more information. Additionally, there is an mdBook extension called [`mdbook-spec`] which adds a variety of custom features used by the Reference.

In addition to the book tooling, there is a variety of testing tools documented in the [tests chapter].

[`mdbook-spec`]: mdbook-spec.md
[Building the Reference]: building.md
[mdbook]: https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/
[tests chapter]: ../tests.md
