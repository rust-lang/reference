# Reference tooling

The Reference uses [mdBook] to convert its source files from Markdown to HTML. See [Building the Reference] for more information. The [`mdbook-spec`] extension adds several custom features used by the Reference.

For testing, see [Running Tests].

[`mdbook-spec`]: mdbook-spec.md
