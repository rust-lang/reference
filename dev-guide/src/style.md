# Style guide

The following sections describe the preferred style for English prose in the Reference.

## Wording

Use American English spelling.

Avoid qualifying something as "in Rust"; the entire Reference is about Rust.

## Punctuation

Use Oxford commas.

Avoid slashes for alternatives ("program/binary"); use a conjunction or rewrite the phrase ("program or binary").
