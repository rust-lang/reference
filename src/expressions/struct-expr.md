r[expr.struct.intro]
A *struct expression* creates a struct, enum, or union value.
It consists of a path to a [struct], [enum variant], or [union] item followed by the values for the fields of the item.
There are three forms of struct expressions: struct, tuple, and unit.

The following are examples of struct expressions:

```rust
# struct Point { x: f64, y: f64 }
# struct NothingInMe { }
# struct TuplePoint(f64, f64);
# mod game { pub struct User<'a> { pub name: &'a str, pub age: u32, pub score: usize } }
# struct Cookie; fn some_fn<T>(t: T) {}
Point {x: 10.0, y: 20.0};
NothingInMe {};
TuplePoint(10.0, 20.0);
TuplePoint { 0: 10.0, 1: 20.0 }; // Results in the same value as the above line
let u = game::User {name: "Joe", age: 35, score: 100_000};
some_fn::<Cookie>(Cookie);
```

r[expr.struct.field]
## Field struct expression

r[expr.struct.field.intro]
A struct expression with fields enclosed in curly braces allows you to specify the value for each individual field in any order.
The field name is separated from its value with a colon.

r[expr.struct.field.union-constraint]
A value of a [union] type can only be created using this syntax, and it must specify exactly one field.

r[expr.struct.update]
## Functional update syntax

r[expr.struct.update.intro]
A struct expression that constructs a value of a struct type can terminate with the syntax `..` followed by an expression to denote a functional update.

r[expr.struct.update.base-same-type]
The expression following `..` (the base) must have the same struct type as the new struct type being formed.

r[expr.struct.update.fields]
The entire expression uses the given values for the fields that were specified and moves or copies the remaining fields from the base expression.

r[expr.struct.update.visibility-constraint]
As with all struct expressions, all of the fields of the struct must be [visible], even those not explicitly named.

```rust
# struct Point3d { x: i32, y: i32, z: i32 }
let mut base = Point3d {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3};
let y_ref = &mut base.y;
Point3d {y: 0, z: 10, .. base}; // OK, only base.x is accessed
drop(y_ref);
```

r[expr.struct.brace-restricted-positions]
Struct expressions with curly braces can't be used directly in a [loop] or [if] expression's head, or in the [scrutinee] of an [if let] or [match] expression.
However, struct expressions can be used in these situations if they are within another expression, for example inside [parentheses].

r[expr.struct.tuple-field]
The field names can be decimal integer values to specify indices for constructing tuple structs.
This can be used with base structs to fill out the remaining indices not specified:

```rust
struct Color(u8, u8, u8);
let c1 = Color(0, 0, 0);  // Typical way of creating a tuple struct.
let c2 = Color{0: 255, 1: 127, 2: 0};  // Specifying fields by index.
let c3 = Color{1: 0, ..c2};  // Fill out all other fields using a base struct.
```

r[expr.struct.field.named]
### Struct field init shorthand

When initializing a data structure (struct, enum, union) with named (but not numbered) fields, it is allowed to write `fieldname` as a shorthand for `fieldname: fieldname`.
This allows a compact syntax with less duplication.
For example:

```rust
# struct Point3d { x: i32, y: i32, z: i32 }
# let x = 0;
# let y_value = 0;
# let z = 0;
Point3d { x: x, y: y_value, z: z };
Point3d { x, y: y_value, z };
```

r[expr.struct.tuple]
## Tuple struct expression

A struct expression with fields enclosed in parentheses constructs a tuple struct.
Though it is listed here as a specific expression for completeness, it is equivalent to a [call expression] to the tuple struct's constructor. For example:

```rust
struct Position(i32, i32, i32);
Position(0, 0, 0);  // Typical way of creating a tuple struct.
let c = Position;  // `c` is a function that takes 3 arguments.
let pos = c(8, 6, 7);  // Creates a `Position` value.
```

r[expr.struct.unit]
## Unit struct expression

A unit struct expression is just the path to a unit struct item.
This refers to the unit struct's implicit constant of its value.
The unit struct value can also be constructed with a fieldless struct expression. For example:

```rust
struct Gamma;
let a = Gamma;  // Gamma unit value.
let b = Gamma{};  // Exact same value as `a`.
```
