r[coerce]
# Type coercions

r[coerce.intro]
**Type coercions** are implicit operations that change the type of a value.
They happen automatically at specific locations and are highly restricted in
what types actually coerce.

r[coerce.as]
Any conversions allowed by coercion can also be explicitly performed by the
[type cast operator], `as`.

Coercions are originally defined in [RFC 401] and expanded upon in [RFC 1558].

r[coerce.site]
## Coercion sites

r[coerce.site.intro]
A coercion can only occur at certain coercion sites in a program; these are
typically places where the desired type is explicit or can be derived by
propagation from explicit types (without type inference). Possible coercion
sites are:

r[coerce.site.let]
* `let` statements where an explicit type is given.

   For example, `&mut 42` is coerced to have type `&i8` in the following:

   ```rust
   let _: &i8 = &mut 42;
   ```

r[coerce.site.value]
* `static` and `const` item declarations (similar to `let` statements).

r[coerce.site.argument]
* Arguments for function calls

  The value being coerced is the actual parameter, and it is coerced to
  the type of the formal parameter.

  For example, `&mut 42` is coerced to have type `&i8` in the following:

  ```rust
  fn bar(_: &i8) { }

  fn main() {
      bar(&mut 42);
  }
  ```

  For method calls, the receiver (`self` parameter) type is coerced
  differently, see the documentation on [method-call expressions] for details.

r[coerce.site.constructor]
* Instantiations of struct, union, or enum variant fields

  For example, `&mut 42` is coerced to have type `&i8` in the following:

  ```rust
  struct Foo<'a> { x: &'a i8 }

  fn main() {
      Foo { x: &mut 42 };
  }
  ```

r[coerce.site.return]
* Function results&mdash;either the final line of a block if it is not
  semicolon-terminated or any expression in a `return` statement

  For example, `x` is coerced to have type `&dyn Display` in the following:

  ```rust
  use std::fmt::Display;
  fn foo(x: &u32) -> &dyn Display {
      x
  }
  ```

r[coerce.site.subexpr]
If the expression in one of these coercion sites is a coercion-propagating
expression, then the relevant sub-expressions in that expression are also
coercion sites. Propagation recurses from these new coercion sites.
Propagating expressions and their relevant sub-expressions are:

r[coerce.site.array]
* Array literals, where the array has type `[U; n]`. Each sub-expression in
the array literal is a coercion site for coercion to type `U`.

r[coerce.site.repeat]
* Array literals with repeating syntax, where the array has type `[U; n]`. The
repeated sub-expression is a coercion site for coercion to type `U`.

r[coerce.site.tuple]
* Tuples, where a tuple is a coercion site to type `(U_0, U_1, ..., U_n)`.
Each sub-expression is a coercion site to the respective type, e.g. the
zeroth sub-expression is a coercion site to type `U_0`.

r[coerce.site.parenthesis]
* Parenthesized sub-expressions (`(e)`): if the expression has type `U`, then
the sub-expression is a coercion site to `U`.

r[coerce.site.block]
* Blocks: if a block has type `U`, then the last expression in the block (if
it is not semicolon-terminated) is a coercion site to `U`. This includes
blocks which are part of control flow statements, such as `if`/`else`, if
the block has a known type.

r[coerce.types]
## Coercion types

r[coerce.types.intro]
Coercion is allowed between the following types:

r[coerce.types.reflexive]
* `T` to `U` if `T` is a [subtype] of `U` (*reflexive case*)

r[coerce.types.transitive]
* `T_1` to `T_3` where `T_1` coerces to `T_2` and `T_2` coerces to `T_3`
(*transitive case*)

    Note that this is not fully supported yet.

r[coerce.types.mut-reborrow]
* `&mut T` to `&T`

r[coerce.types.mut-pointer]
* `*mut T` to `*const T`

r[coerce.types.ref-to-pointer]
* `&T` to `*const T`

r[coerce.types.mut-to-pointer]
* `&mut T` to `*mut T`

r[coerce.types.unsize]
* `T` to `U` if `T: CoerceUnsized<U>`. For example:
    ```rust
    const _: &dyn std::fmt::Display = &0u8; // &u8 -> &dyn Display
    const _: &[u32] = &[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];  // &[u32; 4] -> &[u32]
    ```

    See [unsized coercion](#unsized-coercions) for more details.

r[coerce.types.deref]
* `&T` or `&mut T` to `&U` if `T` implements `Deref<Target = U>`. For example:

  ```rust
  use std::ops::Deref;

  struct CharContainer {
      value: char,
  }

  impl Deref for CharContainer {
      type Target = char;

      fn deref<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a char {
          &self.value
      }
  }

  fn foo(arg: &char) {}

  fn main() {
      let x = &mut CharContainer { value: 'y' };
      foo(x); //&mut CharContainer is coerced to &char.
  }
  ```

r[coerce.types.deref-mut]
* `&mut T` to `&mut U` if `T` implements `DerefMut<Target = U>`.

r[coerce.types.fn]
* Function item types to `fn` pointers

r[coerce.types.closure]
* Non capturing closures to `fn` pointers

r[coerce.types.never]
* `!` to any `T`

r[coerce.unsize]
### Unsized Coercions

r[coerce.unsize.intro]
The following coercions are called "unsized coercions", since their targets contain an unsized type.
unsized coercions apply to pointer-like types which point to types which can lose some of their compile-time known information (such as size or implemented traits). For example:

```rust
use std::cell::Cell;

fn main() {
    // `&[u8; 0]` can be coerced to `&[u8]`.
    //
    // here `&_` is the pointer-like type,
    // `[u8; 0]` is the original pointee,
    // and `[u8]` is more erased pointee (it lost the length information).
    let _: &[u8] = &[];

    trait A: Super {}
    impl A for () {}

    trait Super {}
    impl Super for () {}

    // `&()` can be coerced to `&dyn A`, losing the type information.
    let a: &dyn A = &();

    // `&dyn A` can be coerced to `&dyn Super`,
    // losing the fact that the underlying type (unit) implements `A` too.
    let _: &dyn Super = a;

    // The same coercions work with other pointer-like types and wrappers over them:
    let _: Box<[u8]> = Box::<[u8; 0]>::new([]);
    let _: Cell<Box<[u8]>> = Cell::new(Box::<[u8; 0]>::new([]));

    // The result of the coercion doesn't *have* to be the same pointer-like type,
    // although this is only allowed for certain pairs of pointer-like types.
    let _: *const dyn A = &mut ();
}
```

r[coerce.unsize.confusion]
> [!NOTE]
> The term "unsized" might be quite confusing, since the coercion works on sized types (pointers) and the source pointer might point to an unsized type in the first place (`&dyn A -> &dyn Super` in the example above).
>
> "unsized" refers to the main purpose of these coercions --- converting (pointers to) sized types to (pointers to) unsized types. The pointers being not the focus, since unsized types can't exist without them.

r[coerce.unsize.metadata]
When performing unsized coercion, the pointer metadata type changes. For example, when unsized `&u32` to `&dyn Debug` metadate type changes from `()` to `DynMetadata<dyn Debug>` (note that exact metadata types are not yet stable). This can also lead to a change in the pointer size -- `&u32` is half the size of `&dyn Debug`.

r[coerce.unsize.traits]
Three internal traits, [`Unsize`], [`CoerceUnsized`], and [`PinCoerceUnsized`] are used to assist in this process and expose it for library use.

r[coerce.unsize.traits.unsize]
[`Unsize`] represents the fact that the target type is layout compatible with the source type and the pointer metadata of the target type can be derived from the metadata of the source, meaning that a pointer to the source type can be converted to a pointer to the target type. For example `[T; N]` implements `Unsize<[T]>` meaning that you can *unsize* former into the later, allowing coercions such as `&[T; N] -> &[T]`.

r[coerce.unsize.traits.coerce-unsized]
[`CoerceUnsized`] represents the fact that a pointer-like type can be coerced to another pointer-like type, due to `Unsize` being implemented for their pointees. For example, `&T` implements `CoerceUnsized<&U>` when `T: Unsize<U>`.

r[coerce.unsize.traits.pin-coerce-unsized]
[`PinCoerceUnsized`] is an unsafe marker trait for pointer-like types unsized coercion of which does not break [`Pin`] guarantees. It is a requirement of the `CoerceUnsized` implementation for `Pin`. That is, `&D: PinCoerceUnsized` implies `Pin<&T>: CoerceUnsized<Pin<&U>>`.

The following implementations of [`Unsize`] are built-in:

r[coerce.unsize.slice]
* `[T; n]: Unsize<[T]>`.

r[coerce.unsize.trait-object]
* `T: Unsize<dyn U>`, when `T` implements `U + Sized`, and `U` is [dyn compatible].

r[coerce.unsize.trait-upcast]
* `dyn Trait: Unsize<dyn Super>`, when `Super` is one of `Trait`'s [supertraits].
    * This allows dropping auto traits, i.e. `dyn Trait + Auto` to `dyn Super` is allowed.
    * This allows adding auto traits if the principal trait has the auto trait as a super trait, i.e. given `trait Trait: Super + Auto {}`, `dyn Trait` to `dyn Trait + Auto` or to `dyn Super + Auto` coercions are allowed.

r[coerce.unsize.composite]
* `S<T...>: Unsize<S<U...>>`, when:
    * `S` is a struct.
    * The type of the last field of `S<T...>` implements `Unsize<X>` where `X` is the type of the last field of `S<U...>`.
    * All generic arguments of `S` that are involved in its last field are only involved there (and not in other fields).
    * All generic arguments of `S` that are not involved in its last field are unchanged between `T...` and `U...`.

r[coerce.unsize.pointer]
A type `S<T...>` *can* implement `CoerceUnsized<S<U...>>` if
1. Only one field of `S<T...>` has different type than the same field of `S<U...>` (ignoring fields of type `PhantomData<_>`).
2. ... and that field's type implements `CoerceUnsized<X>` where `X` is the type of the same field in `S<U,...>`.

This allows it to provide an unsized coercion to `S<U...>`.

> [!NOTE]
> While the definition of the unsized coercions and their implementation has been stabilized, the traits themselves are not yet stable and therefore can't be used directly in stable Rust.

r[coerce.least-upper-bound]
## Least upper bound coercions

r[coerce.least-upper-bound.intro]
In some contexts, the compiler must coerce together multiple types to try and
find the most general type. This is called a "Least Upper Bound" coercion.
LUB coercion is used and only used in the following situations:

+ To find the common type for a series of if branches.
+ To find the common type for a series of match arms.
+ To find the common type for array elements.
+ To find the type for the return type of a closure with multiple return statements.
+ To check the type for the return type of a function with multiple return statements.

r[coerce.least-upper-bound.target]
In each such case, there are a set of types `T0..Tn` to be mutually coerced
to some target type `T_t`, which is unknown to start.

r[coerce.least-upper-bound.computation]
Computing the LUB
coercion is done iteratively. The target type `T_t` begins as the type `T0`.
For each new type `Ti`, we consider whether

r[coerce.least-upper-bound.computation-identity]
+ If `Ti` can be coerced to the current target type `T_t`, then no change is made.

r[coerce.least-upper-bound.computation-replace]
+ Otherwise, check whether `T_t` can be coerced to `Ti`; if so, the `T_t` is
changed to `Ti`. (This check is also conditioned on whether all of the source
expressions considered thus far have implicit coercions.)

r[coerce.least-upper-bound.computation-unify]
+ If not, try to compute a mutual supertype of `T_t` and `Ti`, which will become the new target type.

### Examples:

```rust
# let (a, b, c) = (0, 1, 2);
// For if branches
let bar = if true {
    a
} else if false {
    b
} else {
    c
};

// For match arms
let baw = match 42 {
    0 => a,
    1 => b,
    _ => c,
};

// For array elements
let bax = [a, b, c];

// For closure with multiple return statements
let clo = || {
    if true {
        a
    } else if false {
        b
    } else {
        c
    }
};
let baz = clo();

// For type checking of function with multiple return statements
fn foo() -> i32 {
    let (a, b, c) = (0, 1, 2);
    match 42 {
        0 => a,
        1 => b,
        _ => c,
    }
}
```

In these examples, types of the `ba*` are found by LUB coercion. And the
compiler checks whether LUB coercion result of `a`, `b`, `c` is `i32` in the
processing of the function `foo`.

### Caveat

This description is obviously informal. Making it more precise is expected to
proceed as part of a general effort to specify the Rust type checker more
precisely.
