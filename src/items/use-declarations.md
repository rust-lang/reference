A _use declaration_ creates one or more local name bindings synonymous with
some other [path]. Usually a `use` declaration is used to shorten the path
required to refer to a module item. These declarations may appear in [modules]
and [blocks], usually at the top.

Use declarations support a number of convenient shortcuts:

* Simultaneously binding a list of paths with a common prefix, using the
  glob-like brace syntax `use a::b::{c, d, e::f, g::h::i};`
* Simultaneously binding a list of paths with a common prefix and their common
  parent module, using the `self` keyword, such as `use a::b::{self, c, d::e};`
* Rebinding the target name as a new local name, using the syntax `use p::q::r
  as x;`. This can also be used with the last two features:
  `use a::b::{self as ab, c as abc}`.
* Binding all paths matching a given prefix, using the asterisk wildcard syntax
  `use a::b::*;`.
* Nesting groups of the previous features multiple times, such as
  `use a::b::{self as ab, c, d::{*, e::f}};`

An example of `use` declarations:

```rust
use std::option::Option::{Some, None};
use std::collections::hash_map::{self, HashMap};

fn foo<T>(_: T){}
fn bar(map1: HashMap<String, usize>, map2: hash_map::HashMap<String, usize>){}

fn main() {
    // Equivalent to 'foo(vec![std::option::Option::Some(1.0f64),
    // std::option::Option::None]);'
    foo(vec![Some(1.0f64), None]);

    // Both `hash_map` and `HashMap` are in scope.
    let map1 = HashMap::new();
    let map2 = hash_map::HashMap::new();
    bar(map1, map2);
}
```

Like items, `use` declarations are private to the containing module, by
default. Also like items, a `use` declaration can be public, if qualified by
the `pub` keyword. Such a `use` declaration serves to _re-export_ a name. A
public `use` declaration can therefore _redirect_ some public name to a
different target definition: even a definition with a private canonical path,
inside a different module. If a sequence of such redirections form a cycle or
cannot be resolved unambiguously, they represent a compile-time error.

An example of re-exporting:

```rust
# fn main() { }
mod quux {
    pub use quux::foo::{bar, baz};

    pub mod foo {
        pub fn bar() { }
        pub fn baz() { }
    }
}
```

In this example, the module `quux` re-exports two public names defined in
`foo`.

Also note that the paths contained in `use` items are relative to the crate
root. So, in the previous example, the `use` refers to `quux::foo::{bar, baz}`,
and not simply to `foo::{bar, baz}`. This also means that top-level module
declarations should be at the crate root if direct usage of the declared
modules within `use` items is desired. It is also possible to use `self` and
`super` at the beginning of a `use` item to refer to the current and direct
parent modules respectively. All rules regarding accessing declared modules in
`use` declarations apply to both module declarations and `extern crate`
declarations.

An example of what will and will not work for `use` items:

```rust
# #![allow(unused_imports)]
use foo::baz::foobaz;    // good: foo is at the root of the crate

mod foo {

    mod example {
        pub mod iter {}
    }

    use foo::example::iter; // good: foo is at crate root
//  use example::iter;      // bad:  example is not at the crate root
    use self::baz::foobaz;  // good: self refers to module 'foo'
    use foo::bar::foobar;   // good: foo is at crate root

    pub mod bar {
        pub fn foobar() { }
    }

    pub mod baz {
        use super::bar::foobar; // good: super refers to module 'foo'
        pub fn foobaz() { }
    }
}

fn main() {}
```
