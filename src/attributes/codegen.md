# Code generation attributes

The following [attributes] are used for controlling code generation.

## Optimization hints

The `cold` and `inline` [attributes] give suggestions to generate code in a
way that may be faster than what it would do without the hint. The attributes
are only hints, and may be ignored.

Both attributes can be used on [functions]. When applied to a function in a
[trait], they apply only to that function when used as a default function for
a trait implementation and not to all trait implementations. The attributes
have no effect on a trait function without a body.

### The `inline` attribute

The *`inline` [attribute]* suggests that a copy of the attributed function
should be placed in the caller, rather than generating code to call the
function where it is defined.

> ***Note***: The `rustc` compiler automatically inlines functions based on
> internal heuristics. Incorrectly inlining functions can make the program
> slower, so this attribute should be used with care.

There are three ways to use the inline attribute:

* `#[inline]` *suggests* performing an inline expansion.
* `#[inline(always)]` *suggests* that an inline expansion should always be
  performed.
* `#[inline(never)]` *suggests* that an inline expansion should never be
  performed.

> ***Note***: `#[inline]` in every form is a hint, with no *requirements*
> on the language to place a copy of the attributed function in the caller.

### The `cold` attribute

The *`cold` [attribute]* suggests that the attributed function is unlikely to
be called.

## The `naked` attribute

The *`naked` [attribute]* may be applied to a function in order to prevent the compiler
from emitting a function prologue.

### Requirements

Any function marked with the `naked` attribute must meet the following requirements;
failure to do so will result in a compiler error.

* The [function body] must consist of exactly one [`asm!`] macro invocation,
  which may be enclosed within an [unsafe block].
    * This `asm!` invocation must not contain any [operands]
      except for `const` and `sym` operands.
    * This `asm!` invocation must specify the `noreturn` [option],
      and must not specify any other options except for `att_syntax`.
* The function must not be marked with the [`inline`] attribute.

### Recommendations

Any function marked with the `naked` attribute should adhere to the following recommendations;
failure to do so will result in a compiler warning.

* The function should feature an [extern function qualifier] that is not `extern "Rust"`.
* All arguments and return types of the function should be [FFI-safe].

### Effects

Marking a function with the `naked` attribute has the following effects:

* The compiler will not generate a prologue for this function.
  Within the function, all registers will remain precisely as they were set up
  by its caller.
* The compiler will suppress the [`unused_variables`] lint for this function.

### Notes

* The [rules for inline assembly] ordinarily consider it undefined behavior to
  refer to registers not specified as input operands, or to modify
  registers not specified as output operands.
  The reason for this is because ordinarily an `asm!` invocation cannot guarantee
  the state of the registers surrounding the assembly block.
  However, in naked functions the state of the registers is guaranteed
  by adherence to the specified calling convention.
  Therefore, it is not undefined behavior for the `asm!` invocation in a naked function
  to refer to registers without specifying them as operands.
* A naked function that makes use of registers in a way that does not conform
  to the specified calling convention imposes additional safety invariants on its caller,
  and therefore must be marked as an [unsafe function].
* Implementations may assume that naked functions never unwind.
  Unwinding through a naked function is undefined behavior.
* The semantics of naked functions require implementations to set up the call stack
  according to the specified calling convention before executing a naked function,
  even in contexts where setting up the call stack would ordinarily be unnecessary,
  such as when the function is inlined.
  An implementation can fulfill this requirement by guaranteeing that naked functions
  are never inlined.
  However, implementations are not currently required to guarantee that naked functions
  are never inlined.
  In the future it may become a requirement for implementations to guarantee that
  naked functions are never inlined;
  users must not rely on any observable behavior that may result from inlining.
* Although implementations are prohibited from generating code for a naked function that
  contains any instructions that precede the naked function's `asm!` block,
  under some circumstances, implementations may generate code that contains instructions
  *after* a naked function's `asm!` block.
  In the future it may become a requirement for implementations to guarantee
  the absence of any instructions following a naked function's `asm!` block;
  users must not rely on the presence of any trailing instructions.
  If a user of the `naked` attribute relies on the absence of trailing instructions
  for correctness, for the time being it is the user's responsibility to ensure that
  the instructions truly are absent,
  for example by passing any necessary code generation flags to the compiler.

## The `no_builtins` attribute

The *`no_builtins` [attribute]* may be applied at the crate level to disable
optimizing certain code patterns to invocations of library functions that are
assumed to exist.

## The `target_feature` attribute

The *`target_feature` [attribute]* may be applied to a function to
enable code generation of that function for specific platform architecture
features. It uses the [_MetaListNameValueStr_] syntax with a single key of
`enable` whose value is a string of comma-separated feature names to enable.

```rust
# #[cfg(target_feature = "avx2")]
#[target_feature(enable = "avx2")]
unsafe fn foo_avx2() {}
```

Each [target architecture] has a set of features that may be enabled. It is an
error to specify a feature for a target architecture that the crate is not
being compiled for.

It is [undefined behavior] to call a function that is compiled with a feature
that is not supported on the current platform the code is running on.

Functions marked with `target_feature` are not inlined into a context that
does not support the given features. The `#[inline(always)]` attribute may not
be used with a `target_feature` attribute.

`simd128`   | [WebAssembly simd proposal][simd128]

### Additional information

See the [`target_feature` conditional compilation option] for selectively
enabling or disabling compilation of code based on compile-time settings. Note
that this option is not affected by the `target_feature` attribute, and is
only driven by the features enabled for the entire crate.

See the [`is_x86_feature_detected`] macro in the standard library for runtime
feature detection on the x86 platforms.

> Note: `rustc` has a default set of features enabled for each target and CPU.
> The CPU may be chosen with the [`-C target-cpu`] flag. Individual features
> may be enabled or disabled for an entire crate with the
> [`-C target-feature`] flag.

## The `track_caller` attribute

The `track_caller` attribute may be applied to any function with [`"Rust"` ABI][rust-abi]
with the exception of the entry point `fn main`. When applied to functions and methods in
trait declarations, the attribute applies to all implementations. If the trait provides a
default implementation with the attribute, then the attribute also applies to override implementations.

When applied to a function in an `extern` block the attribute must also be applied to any linked
implementations, otherwise undefined behavior results. When applied to a function which is made
available to an `extern` block, the declaration in the `extern` block must also have the attribute,
otherwise undefined behavior results.

### Behavior

Applying the attribute to a function `f` allows code within `f` to get a hint of the [`Location`] of
the "topmost" tracked call that led to `f`'s invocation. At the point of observation, an
implementation behaves as if it walks up the stack from `f`'s frame to find the nearest frame of an
*unattributed* function `outer`, and it returns the [`Location`] of the tracked call in `outer`.

```rust
#[track_caller]
fn f() {
    println!("{}", std::panic::Location::caller());
}
```

> Note: `core` provides [`core::panic::Location::caller`] for observing caller locations. It wraps
> the [`core::intrinsics::caller_location`] intrinsic implemented by `rustc`.

> Note: because the resulting `Location` is a hint, an implementation may halt its walk up the stack
> early. See [Limitations](#limitations) for important caveats.

#### Examples

When `f` is called directly by `calls_f`, code in `f` observes its callsite within `calls_f`:

```rust
# #[track_caller]
# fn f() {
#     println!("{}", std::panic::Location::caller());
# }
fn calls_f() {
    f(); // <-- f() prints this location
}
```

When `f` is called by another attributed function `g` which is in turn called by `calls_g`, code in
both `f` and `g` observes `g`'s callsite within `calls_g`:

```rust
# #[track_caller]
# fn f() {
#     println!("{}", std::panic::Location::caller());
# }
#[track_caller]
fn g() {
    println!("{}", std::panic::Location::caller());
    f();
}

fn calls_g() {
    g(); // <-- g() prints this location twice, once itself and once from f()
}
```

When `g` is called by another attributed function `h` which is in turn called by `calls_h`, all code
in `f`, `g`, and `h` observes `h`'s callsite within `calls_h`:

```rust
# #[track_caller]
# fn f() {
#     println!("{}", std::panic::Location::caller());
# }
# #[track_caller]
# fn g() {
#     println!("{}", std::panic::Location::caller());
#     f();
# }
#[track_caller]
fn h() {
    println!("{}", std::panic::Location::caller());
    g();
}

fn calls_h() {
    h(); // <-- prints this location three times, once itself, once from g(), once from f()
}
```

And so on.

### Limitations

This information is a hint and implementations are not required to preserve it.

In particular, coercing a function with `#[track_caller]` to a function pointer creates a shim which
appears to observers to have been called at the attributed function's definition site, losing actual
caller information across virtual calls. A common example of this coercion is the creation of a
trait object whose methods are attributed.

> Note: The aforementioned shim for function pointers is necessary because `rustc` implements
> `track_caller` in a codegen context by appending an implicit parameter to the function ABI, but
> this would be unsound for an indirect call because the parameter is not a part of the function's
> type and a given function pointer type may or may not refer to a function with the attribute. The
> creation of a shim hides the implicit parameter from callers of the function pointer, preserving
> soundness.
