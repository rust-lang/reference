```

[^matched-fence]: The closing fence must have the same number of `-` as the opening fence
[^escaped-fence]: A `FRONTMATTER_FENCE` at the beginning of a `FRONTMATTER_LINE` is only invalid if it has the same or more `-` as the `FRONTMATTER_FENCE`

Frontmatter is an optional section for content intended for external tools without requiring these tools to have full knowledge of the Rust grammar.

r[frontmatter.document]
Frontmatter may only be preceded by a [shebang] and whitespace.

r[frontmatter.fence]
The delimiters are referred to as a "fence." The opening and closing fences must be at the start of a line. They must be a matching pair of three or more hyphens (`-`). A fence may be followed by horizontal whitespace.

r[frontmatter.infostring]
Following the opening fence may be an infostring for identifying the intention of the contained content. An infostring may be followed by horizontal whitespace.

r[frontmatter.body]
The body of the frontmatter may contain any content except for a line starting with as many or more hyphens (`-`) than in the fences.
