[^matched-fence]: The closing fence must have the same number of `-` as the opening fence
[^escaped-fence]: A `FRONTMATTER_FENCE` at the beginning of a `FRONTMATTER_LINE` is only invalid if it has the same or more `-` as the `FRONTMATTER_FENCE`

r[frontmatter.intro]
Frontmatter is an optional section for content intended for external tools without requiring these tools to have full knowledge of the Rust grammar.

```rust
#!/usr/bin/env cargo
---
[dependencies]
fastrand = "2"
---

fn main() {
    let num = fastrand::i32(..);
    println!("{num}");
}
```

r[frontmatter.document]
Frontmatter may only be preceded by a [shebang] and [whitespace].

r[frontmatter.fence]
The delimiters are referred to as a *fence*. The opening and closing fences must be at the start of a line. They must be a matching pair of hyphens (`-`), from 3 to 255. A fence may be followed by horizontal whitespace.

r[frontmatter.infostring]
Following the opening fence may be an infostring for identifying the intention of the contained content. An infostring may be followed by horizontal whitespace.

r[frontmatter.body]
The body of the frontmatter may contain any content except for a line starting with as many or more hyphens (`-`) than in the fences or carriage returns.
