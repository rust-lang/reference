# Application Binary Interface (ABI)

r[abi]

This section documents features that affect the ABI of the compiled output of
a crate.

See *[extern functions]* for information on specifying the ABI for exporting
functions. See *[`extern` block]s* for information on specifying the ABI for
linking external libraries.

## ABI compatibility

r[abi.compatibility]

r[abi.compatibility.intro]
Function calls pass parameters and return values between the caller and the callee function. This requires the caller and callee to agree on an ABI for those parameters and return values. This is typically only guaranteed when the same type is used in both the call site and the definition site of the callee. However, differences between caller and callee types can appear when transmuting a [function pointer] or using an [`extern` block] to call a function. This is permitted if the caller and callee types are *abi compatible* (otherwise, it is undefined behavior). If the types are abi compatible, the parameters are transmuted to the callee type as part of the call and the return value is transmuted to the caller type upon return.

> [!NOTE]
> This can include calls to functions defined outside of Rust, or built using a different Rust compiler version.
> Additional guarantees will apply in this case for "FFI Safe" types, which match up with the platform C ABI in well-defined ways.
> These are not fully documented here currently.

> [!WARNING]
> Two types that are ABI Compatible may not allow the same set of values (e.g. [`*const T`] and [`core::ptr::NonNull<T>`]).
> If an invalid value is passed as a parameter or returned from a function, the result is immediate undefined behaviour, even if the parameter or return value is never used.
> For example, passing a null pointer to a function that accepts a `NonNull<i32>` parameter via `fn(*const i32)` function pointer caused undefined behaviour.

r[abi.compatibility.integer]
Two [integer types] are *abi compatible* if they have the same width and the same signedness.

> [!NOTE]
> The width of an integer type is the number of bits, e.g. `u8` has a width of 8, and `i128` has a width of 128.

> [!NOTE]
> In particular, [`usize`] is *abi compatible* with `uN`, and `isize` is *abi compatible* with `iN` where `N` is the target_pointer_width.
> Two integer types with different signedness, such as `u8` and `i8` are not *abi compatible*.

```rust
#[cfg(target_pointer_width = "32")]
fn foo(x: u32) -> u32 {
    x
}
#[cfg(target_pointer_width = "64")]
fn foo(x: u64) -> u64 {
    x
}

fn main() {
    let f: fn(usize) -> usize = unsafe { core::mem::transmute(foo as fn(_) -> _) };
    let x = 0usize;
    let y = f(x);
    assert_eq!(x, y);
}
```

r[abi.compatibility.char]
The type [`char`] is *abi compatible* with the type [`u32`][integer types].

```rust
fn foo(x: char) -> u32{
    x as u32
}

fn main(){
    let f: fn(u32)->char = unsafe{core::mem::transmute(foo as fn(_)->_)};
    let x = b'A' as u32; // ascii character indices are the same as Unicode character indices
    let y = f(x);
    assert_eq!(y, 'A');
}
```

r[abi.compatibility.pointer]
Two [pointer types], `*mut T` and `*const U`, are *abi compatible* if the *metadata type*s of `T` and `U` are the same type.

> [!NOTE]
> [`core::marker::Sized`] types have a *metadata type* of `()`.

> [!NOTE]
> With transitivity, this applies regardless of the mutability of either pointer type

```rust
unsafe fn foo(x: *mut u32){
   unsafe{x.write(5);}
}

fn main(){
    let f: unsafe fn(*mut ()) = unsafe{core::mem::transmute(foo as unsafe fn(_))}; // Type Erase the function
    let mut val: u32 = 0;
    let ptr = core::ptr::addr_of_mut!(val).cast::<()>(); // Get Opaque Userdata from somewhere
    unsafe{f(ptr);}
    assert_eq!(val, 5);
}
```

r[abi.compatibility.reference-box]
The types [`&T`], [`&mut T`], [`alloc::boxed::Box<T>`], and [`core::ptr::NonNull<T>`], are *abi compatible* with `*const T`

> [!NOTE]
> With transitivity, they are also *abi compatible* with each other, and with `*mut T`, as well as references/`Box` to different types that have the same *metadata type*.

```rust
fn foo(x: &mut i32){
   *x = 5;
}

fn main(){
    let f: unsafe fn(*mut ()) = unsafe{core::mem::transmute(foo as fn(_))}; // Type Erase the function
    let mut val = 0;
    let ptr = core::ptr::addr_of_mut!(val).cast::<()>(); // Get Opaque Userdata from somewhere
    unsafe{f(ptr);}
    assert_eq!(val, 5);
}
```

r[abi.compatibility.core]
The types [`core::mem::MaybeUninit<T>`], [`core::cell::UnsafeCell<T>`], and [`core::num::NonZero<T>`], are *abi compatible* with `T`.

r[abi.compatibility.transparent]
A [`struct`] declared with the `transparent` representation is *abi compatible* with its field that does not have size 0 and alignment 1, if such a field exists.

r[abi.compatibility.zst]
Two types, `T` and `U`, are *abi compatible* if both have size 0 and alignment 1.

r[abi.compatibility.discriminant]
If `T` is an a type listed in [layout.repr.rust.option.elision], and `U` is the type of the *elision candidate field*, then `T` is layout compatible with `U`.

> [!NOTE]
> `Option<U>`, `Result<U,Z>`, or `Result<Z,U>` are examples of such types, when `U` are *elision candidate type*s, and `Z` is a 1-ZST type.
>
> Due to transitivity, two such types are *abi compatible* with each other if their *elision candidate field*s are *abi comaptible*

r[abi.compatibility.fn-ptr]
A [function pointer] type `T` is *abi compatible* with an [function pointer] type `U` if `T` and `U` have *abi compatible* tags.

r[abi.compatibility.equivalence]
Two types `T` and `U` are *abi compatible* if:
* They are the same type,
* `U` is *abi compatible* with `T`, or
* There exists a type `V`, such that `T` is *abi compatible* with `V` an `V` is *abi compatible* with `U`,

> [!NOTE]
> These properties are respectively called "reflexivity", "symmetry", and "transitivity". They ensure that *abi compatibility* is an equivalence relation.
> ABI compatibility is a pairwise relation between two types. With Transivity and Symmetry, however, it can be well-defined to refer to several types being ABI compatible

r[abi.compatibility.extern-tag]
Two [abi tags][abi tag] are *abi compatible* if:
* They are the same string, or
* One tag is `"X"`, and the other is `"X-unwind"`

> [!NOTE]
> e.g. `extern "C"` and `extern "C-unwind"` are compatible with each other.

r[abi.compatibility.signature]
Two function signatures are compatible if:
* The [abi tags][abi tag] of both signatures are *abi compatible*,
* They have the same number of parameters, excluding C-varargs,
* The return types of both signatures are *abi comaptible*,
* Each parameter of both signatures, in order, are *abi compatible*, and
* Either both signatures have C-varargs, or neither signature does.

> [!NOTE]
> A signature is compatible with itself.


r[abi.compatibility.call]
A call to a function `f` via a function item or function pointer with a given signature `S` is valid if and only if the signature of the definition `f` is *compatible* with the signature `S`. The behavior of a call that is not valid is undefined.

## The `used` attribute

r[abi.used]

The `#[used]` attribute allows indicating that a `static` item should be considered to be used by the program from outside of Rust and not discarded by the compiler.

> **<sup>Attribute Syntax</sup>**\
> _MetaItemUsed_ :\
> &nbsp;&nbsp; `used`

r[abi.used.syntax]
The *`used` attribute* may be specified as a built-in attribute, using the [_MetaWord_] syntax.

r[abi.used.restriction]
The `used` attribute shall only be applied to a `static` item. It shall not be applied to a `static` item declared within an [`extern` block].

```rust
#[used]
static FOO: u32 = 0;
```

r[abi.used.application]
A `static` item with the `used` attribute is an *exported item*.

> [!NOTE]
> *exported items* will generally appear in the output when linking a library crate, and will generally be available when linking a binary crate as a global symbol.
> The `used` attribute does not give the `static` item a *linkage name*, and thus does not disable name mangling. It may be used to place data into a given section that is referenced by the linker via the input section, without regard to the name of the symbol.
> Due to toolchain limitations, it is not guaranteed that a `#[used]` static will appear in the final output when linking a binary, or when linking an rlib/staticlib crate into a `dylib` or `cdylib`.

``` rust
// foo.rs

// This is kept because of `#[used]`:
#[used]
static FOO: u32 = 0;

// This is removable because it is unused:
#[allow(dead_code)]
static BAR: u32 = 0;

// This is kept because it is publicly reachable:
pub static BAZ: u32 = 0;

// This is kept because it is referenced by a public, reachable function:
static QUUX: u32 = 0;

pub fn quux() -> &'static u32 {
    &QUUX
}

// This is removable because it is referenced by a private, unused (dead) function:
static CORGE: u32 = 0;

#[allow(dead_code)]
fn corge() -> &'static u32 {
    &CORGE
}
```

``` console
$ rustc -O --emit=obj --crate-type=rlib foo.rs

$ nm -C foo.o
0000000000000000 R foo::BAZ
0000000000000000 r foo::FOO
0000000000000000 R foo::QUUX
0000000000000000 T foo::quux
```

<a id="the-no_mangle-attribute"></a>
<a id="the-export_name-attribute"></a>

## Symbol naming

r[abi.symbol-name]

The `no_mangle` and `export_name` attributes allow you to control which symbols are exported from rust code under provided symbol names.

> **<sup>Attribute Syntax</sup>**\
> _MetaItemNoMangle_ :\
> &nbsp;&nbsp; `no_mangle`
> _MetaItemExportName_ :\
> &nbsp;&nbsp; `export_name` `=` (_STRING_LITERAL | _RAW_STRING_LITERAL_)

r[abi.symbol-name.names]
The *`export_name` attribute* shall only be applied to a `static` or `fn` item. The *`export_name` attribute* shall not be applied to an item declared within an [`extern` block].

```rust
#[unsafe(no_mangle)]
extern "C" fn foo(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

#[unsafe(export_name = "bar")]
extern "C" fn baz(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 2
}
```

```rust,compile_fail
unsafe extern "C" {
    #[unsafe(export_name = "foo")]
    unsafe fn __foo(x: i32) -> i32;  // error: not a free function, impl method, or static
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> They may be applied to an associated `fn` of an `impl` block.

r[abi.symbol-name.exported]
An item with either the *`no_mangle` attribute* or the *`export_name` attribute* is an *exported item*.

r[abi.symbol-name.no_mangle]
The *`no_mangle` attribute* may be specified as a built-in attribute, using the [_MetaWord_] syntax. The *export name* of an item with the *`no_mangle` attribute* is the declaration name of the item.

```rust
unsafe extern "C" {
    unsafe fn bar() -> i32;
}
mod inner{
    #[unsafe(no_mangle)]
    extern "C" fn bar() -> i32 {
        0
    }
}

fn main() {
    let y = unsafe {bar()};
    assert_eq!(y,0);
}
```

r[abi.symbol-name.export_name]
The *`export_name` attribute* may be specified as a built-in attribute, using the [_MetaNameValueStr_] syntax. The *export name* of an item with the *`no_mangle` attribute* is the content of `STRING_LITERAL`.

```rust
unsafe extern "C" {
    unsafe fn bar() -> i32;
}
mod inner{
    #[unsafe(export_name = "bar")]
    extern "C" fn __some_other_item_name() -> i32 {
        0
    }
}

fn main(){
    let y = unsafe {bar()};
    assert_eq!(y,0);
}
```

r[abi.symbol-name.safety]
These attributes are unsafe as an unmangled symbol may collide with another symbol
with the same name (or with a well-known symbol), leading to undefined behavior.

```rust
#[unsafe(no_mangle)]
extern "C" fn foo() {}
```

> **Edition differences**: Before the 2024 edition it is allowed to use the `no_mangle` and `export_name` attributes without the `unsafe` qualification.

## The `link_section` attribute

r[abi.link_section]

The `link_section` attribute allows a program to control the section that certain items are placed into.

> **<sup>Attribute Syntax</sup>**\
> _MetaItemLinkSection_ :\
> &nbsp;&nbsp; `link_section` `=` (_STRING_LITERAL_ | _RAW_STRING_LITERAL_)

r[abi.link_section.syntax]
The *`link_section` attribute* may be specified as a built-in attribute, using the [_MetaNameValueStr_] syntax.

r[abi.link_section.application]
The *`link_section` attribute* shall be applied to a `static` or `fn` item.

r[abi.link_section.safety]
This attribute is unsafe as it allows users to place data and code into sections of memory not expecting them, such as mutable data into read-only areas.

<!-- no_run: don't link. The format of the section name is platform-specific. -->
```rust,no_run
#[unsafe(no_mangle)]
#[unsafe(link_section = ".example_section")]
pub static VAR1: u32 = 1;
```

> **Edition differences**: Before the 2024 edition it is allowed to use the `link_section` attribute without the `unsafe` qualification.
