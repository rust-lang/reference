## Behavior considered undefined

Rust code is incorrect if it exhibits any of the behaviors in the following
list. This includes code within `unsafe` blocks and `unsafe` functions.
`unsafe` only means that avoiding undefined behavior is on the programmer; it
does not change anything about the fact that Rust programs must never cause
undefined behavior.

It is the programmer's responsibility when writing `unsafe` code to ensure that
any safe code interacting with the `unsafe` code cannot trigger these
behaviors. `unsafe` code that satisfies this property for any safe client is
called *sound*; if `unsafe` code can be misused by safe code to exhibit
undefined behavior, it is *unsound*.

<div class="warning">

***Warning:*** The following list is not exhaustive. There is no formal model of
Rust's semantics for what is and is not allowed in unsafe code, so there may be
more behavior considered unsafe. The following list is just what we know for
sure is undefined behavior. Please read the [Rustonomicon] before writing unsafe
code.

* Data races.
* Dereferencing (using the `*` operator on) a dangling or unaligned raw pointer.
* Breaking the [pointer aliasing rules]. `&mut T` and `&T` follow LLVMâ€™s scoped
  [noalias] model, except if the `&T` contains an [`UnsafeCell<U>`].
* Mutating immutable data. All data inside a [`const`] item is immutable. Moreover, all
  data reached through a shared reference or data owned by an immutable binding
  is immutable, unless that data is contained within an [`UnsafeCell<U>`].
* Invoking undefined behavior via compiler intrinsics.
* Executing code compiled with platform features that the current platform
  does not support (see [`target_feature`]).
* Calling a function with the wrong call ABI or unwinding from a function with the wrong unwind ABI.
* Producing an invalid value, even in private fields and locals. "Producing" a
  value happens any time a value is assigned to or read from a place, passed to
  a function/primitive operation or returned from a function/primitive
  operation.
  The following values are invalid (at their respective type):
  * A value other than `false` (`0`) or `true` (`1`) in a `bool`.
  * A discriminant in an `enum` not included in the type definition.
  * A null `fn` pointer.
  * A value in a `char` which is a surrogate or above `char::MAX`.
  * A `!` (all values are invalid for this type).
  * An integer (`i*`/`u*`), floating point value (`f*`), or raw pointer obtained
    from [uninitialized memory][undef], or uninitialized memory in a `str`.
  * A reference or `Box<T>` that is dangling, unaligned, or points to an invalid value.
  * Invalid metadata in a wide reference, `Box<T>`, or raw pointer:
    * `dyn Trait` metadata is invalid if it is not a pointer to a vtable for
      `Trait` that matches the actual dynamic trait the pointer or reference points to.
    * Slice metadata is invalid if the length is not a valid `usize`
      (i.e., it must not be read from uninitialized memory).
  * Invalid values for a type with a custom definition of invalid values.
    In the standard library, this affects [`NonNull<T>`] and [`NonZero*`].

A reference/pointer is "dangling" if it is null or not all of the bytes it
points to are part of the same allocation (so in particular they all have to be
part of *some* allocation). The span of bytes it points to is determined by the
pointer value and the size of the pointee type (using `size_of_val`). As a
consequence, if the span is empty, "dangling" is the same as "non-null". Note
that slices and strings point to their entire range, so it is important that the length
metadata is never too large. In particular, allocations and therefore slices and strings
cannot be bigger than `isize::MAX` bytes.
