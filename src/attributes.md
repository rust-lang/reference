An _attribute_ is a general, free-form metadatum that is interpreted according
to name, convention, and language and compiler version. Attributes are modeled
on Attributes in [ECMA-335], with the syntax coming from [ECMA-334] \(C#).

Attributes may appear as any of:

* A single identifier, the _attribute name_
* An identifier followed by the equals sign '=' and a literal, providing a
  key/value pair
* An identifier followed by a parenthesized literal, providing a
  key/value pair
* An identifier followed by a parenthesized list of sub-attribute arguments

_Inner attributes_, written with a bang ("!") after the hash ("#"), apply to the
item that the attribute is declared within. _Outer attributes_, written without
the bang after the hash, apply to the item or generic parameter that follow the
attribute.

Attributes may be applied to many things in the language:

* All [item declarations] accept outer attributes while [external blocks],
  [functions], [implementations], and [modules] accept inner attributes.
* [Statements] accept outer attributes.
* [Block expressions] accept outer and inner attributes, but only when they are
  the outer expression of an [expression statement] or the final expression of
  another block expression.
* [Enum] variants and [struct] and [union] fields accept outer attributes.
* [Match expression arms][match expressions] accept outer attributes.
* [Generic lifetime or type parameter][generics] accept outer attributes.

Some examples of attributes:

```rust
// General metadata applied to the enclosing module or crate.
#![crate_type = "lib"]

// A function marked as a unit test
#[test]
fn test_foo() {
    /* ... */
}

// A conditionally-compiled module
#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
mod bar {
    /* ... */
}

// A lint attribute used to suppress a warning/error
#[allow(non_camel_case_types)]
type int8_t = i8;

// Outer attribute applies to the entire function.
fn some_unused_variables() {
  #![allow(unused_variables)]
  
  let x = ();
  let y = ();
  let z = ();
}
```

The rest of this page describes or links to descriptions of which attribute
names have meaning.

## Crate-only attributes

- `crate_name` - specify the crate's crate name.
- `crate_type` - see [linkage](linkage.html).
- `no_builtins` - disable optimizing certain code patterns to invocations of
                  library functions that are assumed to exist
- `no_main` - disable emitting the `main` symbol. Useful when some other
   object being linked to defines `main`.
- `no_start` - disable linking to the `native` crate, which specifies the
  "start" language item.
- `no_std` - disable linking to the `std` crate.
- `recursion_limit` - Sets the maximum depth for potentially
                      infinitely-recursive compile-time operations like
                      auto-dereference or macro expansion. The default is
                      `#![recursion_limit="64"]`.
- `windows_subsystem` - Indicates that when this crate is linked for a Windows
                        target it will configure the resulting binary's
                        [subsystem] via the linker. Valid values for this
                        attribute are `console` and `windows`, corresponding to
                        those two respective subsystems. More subsystems may be
                        allowed in the future, and this attribute is ignored on
                        non-Windows targets.

## Module-only attributes

- `no_implicit_prelude` - disable injecting `use std::prelude::*` in this
  module.
- `path` - specifies the file to load the module from. `#[path="foo.rs"] mod
  bar;` is equivalent to `mod bar { /* contents of foo.rs */ }`. The path is
  taken relative to the directory that the current module is in.

## Function-only attributes

- `test` - indicates that this function is a test function, to only be compiled
  in case of `--test`.
  - `ignore` - indicates that this test function is disabled.
- `should_panic` - indicates that this test function should panic, inverting the
  success condition.
- `cold` - The function is unlikely to be executed, so optimize it (and calls
  to it) differently.

## FFI attributes

On an `extern` block, the following attributes are interpreted:

- `link_args` - specify arguments to the linker, rather than just the library
  name and type. This is feature gated and the exact behavior is
  implementation-defined (due to variety of linker invocation syntax).
- `link` - indicate that a native library should be linked to for the
  declarations in this block to be linked correctly. `link` supports an optional
  `kind` key with three possible values: `dylib`, `static`, and `framework`. See
  [external blocks](items/external-blocks.html) for more about external blocks.
  Two examples: `#[link(name = "readline")]` and
  `#[link(name = "CoreFoundation", kind = "framework")]`.
- `linked_from` - indicates what native library this block of FFI items is
  coming from. This attribute is of the form `#[linked_from = "foo"]` where
  `foo` is the name of a library in either `#[link]` or a `-l` flag. This
  attribute is currently required to export symbols from a Rust dynamic library
  on Windows, and it is feature gated behind the `linked_from` feature.

On declarations inside an `extern` block, the following attributes are
interpreted:

- `link_name` - the name of the symbol that this function or static should be
  imported as.
- `linkage` - on a static, this specifies the [linkage
  type](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#linkage-types).

See [type layout](type-layout.html) for documentation on the `repr` attribute
which can be used to control type layout.

## Macro-related attributes

- `macro_use` on a `mod` — macros defined in this module will be visible in the
  module's parent, after this module has been included.

- `macro_use` on an `extern crate` — load macros from this crate.  An optional
  list of names `#[macro_use(foo, bar)]` restricts the import to just those
  macros named.  The `extern crate` must appear at the crate root, not inside
  `mod`, which ensures proper function of the [`$crate` macro
  variable](../book/first-edition/macros.html#the-variable-crate).

- `macro_reexport` on an `extern crate` — re-export the named macros.

- `macro_export` - export a macro for cross-crate usage.

- `no_link` on an `extern crate` — even if we load this crate for macros, don't
  link it into the output.

See the [macros section of the first edition of the
book](../book/first-edition/macros.html#scoping-and-macro-importexport) for more
information on macro scope.

## Miscellaneous attributes

- `export_name` - on statics and functions, this determines the name of the
  exported symbol.
- `global_allocator` - when applied to a static item implementing the
  `GlobalAlloc` trait, sets the global allocator.
- `link_section` - on statics and functions, this specifies the section of the
  object file that this item's contents will be placed into.
- `no_mangle` - on any item, do not apply the standard name mangling. Set the
  symbol for this item to its identifier.

### Deprecation

The `deprecated` attribute marks an item as deprecated. It has two optional
fields, `since` and `note`.

- `since` expects a version number, as in `#[deprecated(since = "1.4.1")]`
    - `rustc` doesn't know anything about versions, but external tools like
      `clippy` may check the validity of this field.
- `note` is a free text field, allowing you to provide an explanation about
  the deprecation and preferred alternatives.

Only [public items](visibility-and-privacy.html) can be given the
`#[deprecated]` attribute. `#[deprecated]` on a module is inherited by all
child items of that module.

`rustc` will issue warnings on usage of `#[deprecated]` items. `rustdoc` will
show item deprecation, including the `since` version and `note`, if available.

Here's an example.

```rust
#[deprecated(since = "5.2", note = "foo was rarely used. Users should instead use bar")]
pub fn foo() {}

pub fn bar() {}
```

The [RFC][1270-deprecation.md] contains motivations and more details.

[1270-deprecation.md]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1270-deprecation.md

### Documentation

The `doc` attribute is used to document items and fields. [Doc comments]
are transformed into `doc` attributes.

See [The Rustdoc Book] for reference material on this attribute.

### Conditional compilation

The `cfg` and `cfg_attr` attributes control conditional compilation of [items]
and attributes. See the [conditional compilation] section for reference material
on these attributes.

### Lint check attributes

A lint check names a potentially undesirable coding pattern, such as
unreachable code or omitted documentation, for the static entity to which the
attribute applies.

For any lint check `C`:

* `allow(C)` overrides the check for `C` so that violations will go
   unreported,
* `deny(C)` signals an error after encountering a violation of `C`,
* `forbid(C)` is the same as `deny(C)`, but also forbids changing the lint
   level afterwards,
* `warn(C)` warns about violations of `C` but continues compilation.

The lint checks supported by the compiler can be found via `rustc -W help`,
along with their default settings.  [Compiler
plugins][unstable book plugin] can provide additional lint checks.

```rust
pub mod m1 {
    // Missing documentation is ignored here
    #[allow(missing_docs)]
    pub fn undocumented_one() -> i32 { 1 }

    // Missing documentation signals a warning here
    #[warn(missing_docs)]
    pub fn undocumented_too() -> i32 { 2 }

    // Missing documentation signals an error here
    #[deny(missing_docs)]
    pub fn undocumented_end() -> i32 { 3 }
}
```

This example shows how one can use `allow` and `warn` to toggle a particular
check on and off:

```rust
#[warn(missing_docs)]
pub mod m2{
    #[allow(missing_docs)]
    pub mod nested {
        // Missing documentation is ignored here
        pub fn undocumented_one() -> i32 { 1 }

        // Missing documentation signals a warning here,
        // despite the allow above.
        #[warn(missing_docs)]
        pub fn undocumented_two() -> i32 { 2 }
    }

    // Missing documentation signals a warning here
    pub fn undocumented_too() -> i32 { 3 }
}
```

This example shows how one can use `forbid` to disallow uses of `allow` for
that lint check:

```rust,compile_fail
#[forbid(missing_docs)]
pub mod m3 {
    // Attempting to toggle warning signals an error here
    #[allow(missing_docs)]
    /// Returns 2.
    pub fn undocumented_too() -> i32 { 2 }
}
```

#### `must_use` Attribute

The `must_use` attribute can be used on user-defined composite types
([`struct`s][struct], [`enum`s][enum], and [`union`s][union]) and [functions].

When used on user-defined composite types, if the [expression] of an
[expression statement] has that type, then the `unused_must_use` lint is
violated.

```rust
#[must_use]
struct MustUse {
  // some fields
}

# impl MustUse {
#   fn new() -> MustUse { MustUse {} }
# }
#
fn main() {
  // Violates the `unused_must_use` lint.
  MustUse::new();
}
```

When used on a function, if the [expression] of an
[expression statement] is a [call expression] to that function, then the
`unused_must_use` lint is violated. The exceptions to this is if the return type
of the function is `()`, `!`, or a [zero-variant enum], in which case the
attribute does nothing.

```rust
#[must_use]
fn five() -> i32 { 5i32 }

fn main() {
  // Violates the unused_must_use lint.
  five();
}
```

When used on a function in a trait declaration, then the behavior also applies
when the call expression is a function from an implementation of the trait.

```rust
trait Trait {
  #[must_use]
  fn use_me(&self) -> i32;
}

impl Trait for i32 {
  fn use_me(&self) -> i32 { 0i32 }
}

fn main() {
  // Violates the `unused_must_use` lint.
  5i32.use_me();
}
```

When used on a function in an implementation, the attribute does nothing.

> Note: Trivial no-op expressions containing the value will not violate the
> lint. Examples include wrapping the value in a type that does not implement
> [`Drop`] and then not using that type and being the final expression of a
> [block expression] that is not used.
>
> ```rust
> #[must_use]
> fn five() -> i32 { 5i32 }
>
> fn main() {
>   // None of these violate the unused_must_use lint.
>   (five(),);
>   Some(five());
>   { five() };
>   if true { five() } else { 0i32 };
>   match true {
>     _ => five()
>   };
> }
> ```

> Note: It is idiomatic to use a [let statement] with a pattern of `_`
> when a must-used value is purposely discarded.
>
> ```rust
> #[must_use]
> fn five() -> i32 { 5i32 }
>
> fn main() {
>   // Does not violate the unused_must_use lint.
>   let _ = five();
> }
> ```

The `must_use` attribute may also include a message by using
`#[must_use = "message"]`. The message will be given alongside the warning.

### Inline attribute

The inline attribute suggests that the compiler should place a copy of
the function or static in the caller, rather than generating code to
call the function or access the static where it is defined.

The compiler automatically inlines functions based on internal heuristics.
Incorrectly inlining functions can actually make the program slower, so it
should be used with care.

`#[inline]` and `#[inline(always)]` always cause the function to be serialized
into the crate metadata to allow cross-crate inlining.

There are three different types of inline attributes:

* `#[inline]` hints the compiler to perform an inline expansion.
* `#[inline(always)]` asks the compiler to always perform an inline expansion.
* `#[inline(never)]` asks the compiler to never perform an inline expansion.

### `derive`

The `derive` attribute allows certain traits to be automatically implemented
for data structures. For example, the following will create an `impl` for the
`PartialEq` and `Clone` traits for `Foo`, the type parameter `T` will be given
the `PartialEq` or `Clone` constraints for the appropriate `impl`:

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Clone)]
struct Foo<T> {
    a: i32,
    b: T,
}
```

The generated `impl` for `PartialEq` is equivalent to

```rust
# struct Foo<T> { a: i32, b: T }
impl<T: PartialEq> PartialEq for Foo<T> {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Foo<T>) -> bool {
        self.a == other.a && self.b == other.b
    }

    fn ne(&self, other: &Foo<T>) -> bool {
        self.a != other.a || self.b != other.b
    }
}
```

You can implement `derive` for your own trait through [procedural macros].
