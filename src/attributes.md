FOO BAR An _attribute_ is a general, free-form metadatum that is interpreted according
to name, convention, and language and compiler version. Attributes are modeled
on Attributes in [ECMA-335], with the syntax coming from [ECMA-334] \(C#).

_Inner attributes_, written with a bang (`!`) after the hash (`#`), apply to the
item that the attribute is declared within. _Outer attributes_, written without
the bang after the hash, apply to the thing that follows the attribute.

The attribute consists of a path to the attribute, followed by an optional
delimited token tree whose interpretation is defined by the attribute.
Attributes other than macro attributes also allow the input to be an equals
sign (`=`) followed by a literal expression. See the [meta item
syntax](#meta-item-attribute-syntax) below for more details.

Attributes can be classified into the following kinds:

* Built-in attributes
* [Macro attributes][attribute macro]
* [Derive macro helper attributes]
* [Tool attributes](#tool-attributes)

Attributes may be applied to many things in the language:

* All [item declarations] accept outer attributes while [external blocks],
  [functions], [implementations], and [modules] accept inner attributes.
* Most [statements] accept outer attributes (see [Expression Attributes] for
  limitations on expression statements).
* [Block expressions] accept outer and inner attributes, but only when they are
  the outer expression of an [expression statement] or the final expression of
  another block expression.
* [Enum] variants and [struct] and [union] fields accept outer attributes.
* [Match expression arms][match expressions] accept outer attributes.
* [Generic lifetime or type parameter][generics] accept outer attributes.
* Expressions accept outer attributes in limited situations, see [Expression
  Attributes] for details.

Some examples of attributes:

```rust
// General metadata applied to the enclosing module or crate.
#![crate_type = "lib"]

// A function marked as a unit test
#[test]
fn test_foo() {
    /* ... */
}

// A conditionally-compiled module
#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
mod bar {
    /* ... */
}

// A lint attribute used to suppress a warning/error
#[allow(non_camel_case_types)]
type int8_t = i8;

// Inner attribute applies to the entire function.
fn some_unused_variables() {
  #![allow(unused_variables)]

  let x = ();
  let y = ();
  let z = ();
}
```

## Meta Item Attribute Syntax

A "meta item" is the syntax used for the _Attr_ rule by most built-in
attributes and the [`meta` macro fragment specifier]. It has the following
grammar:

> **<sup>Syntax</sup>**\
> _MetaItem_ :\
> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; [_SimplePath_]\
> &nbsp;&nbsp; | [_SimplePath_] `=` [_LiteralExpression_]<sub>_without suffix_</sub>\
> &nbsp;&nbsp; | [_SimplePath_] `(` _MetaSeq_<sup>?</sup> `)`
>
> _MetaSeq_ :\
> &nbsp;&nbsp; _MetaItemInner_ ( `,` MetaItemInner )<sup>\*</sup> `,`<sup>?</sup>
>
> _MetaItemInner_ :\
> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; _MetaItem_\
> &nbsp;&nbsp; | [_LiteralExpression_]<sub>_without suffix_</sub>

Literal expressions in meta items must not include integer or float type
suffixes.

Some examples of meta items are:
- `no_std`
- `doc = "example"`
- `cfg(any())`
- `deprecated(since = "1.2.0", note = "text")`
- `repr(align(32))`

## Active and inert attributes

An attribute is either active or inert. During attribute processing, *active
attributes* remove themselves from the thing they are on while *inert attributes*
stay on.

The `cfg` and `cfg_attr` attributes are active. The `test` attribute is inert
when compiling for tests and active otherwise. Attribute macros are active.
All other attributes are inert.

names have meaning.

## Crate-only attributes

> **Note**: This section is in the process of being removed, with specific
> sections for each attribute. It is not the full list of crate-root attributes.

- `crate_name` - specify the crate's crate name.
- `crate_type` - see [linkage](linkage.html).
- `no_builtins` - disable optimizing certain code patterns to invocations of
                  library functions that are assumed to exist
- `no_main` - disable emitting the `main` symbol. Useful when some other
   object being linked to defines `main`.
- `no_start` - disable linking to the `native` crate, which specifies the
  "start" language item.
- `recursion_limit` - Sets the maximum depth for potentially
                      infinitely-recursive compile-time operations like
                      auto-dereference or macro expansion. The default is
                      `#![recursion_limit="64"]`.
- `windows_subsystem` - Indicates that when this crate is linked for a Windows
                        target it will configure the resulting binary's
                        [subsystem] via the linker. Valid values for this
                        attribute are `console` and `windows`, corresponding to
                        those two respective subsystems. More subsystems may be
                        allowed in the future, and this attribute is ignored on
                        non-Windows targets.

[subsystem]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fcc1zstk.aspx

## FFI attributes

On an `extern` block, the following attributes are interpreted:

- `link` - indicate that a native library should be linked to for the
  declarations in this block to be linked correctly. `link` supports an optional
  `kind` key with three possible values: `dylib`, `static`, and `framework`. See
  [external blocks](items/external-blocks.html) for more about external blocks.
  Two examples: `#[link(name = "readline")]` and
  `#[link(name = "CoreFoundation", kind = "framework")]`.

On declarations inside an `extern` block, the following attributes are
interpreted:

- `link_name` - the name of the symbol that this function or static should be
  imported as.

See [type layout](type-layout.html) for documentation on the `repr` attribute
which can be used to control type layout.

## Macro-related attributes

- `macro_use` on a `mod` — macros defined in this module will be visible in the
  module's parent, after this module has been included.

- `macro_use` on an `extern crate` — load macros from this crate.  An optional
  list of names `#[macro_use(foo, bar)]` restricts the import to just those
  macros named.  The `extern crate` must appear at the crate root, not inside
  `mod`, which ensures proper function of the `$crate` macro variable.

- `macro_export` - export a `macro_rules` macro for cross-crate usage.

- `no_link` on an `extern crate` — even if we load this crate for macros, don't
  link it into the output.

- `proc_macro` - Defines a [function-like macro].

- `proc_macro_derive` - Defines a [derive macro].

- `proc_macro_attribute` - Defines an [attribute macro].

## Miscellaneous attributes

- `export_name` - on statics and functions, this determines the name of the
  exported symbol.
- `global_allocator` - when applied to a static item implementing the
  `GlobalAlloc` trait, sets the global allocator.
- `link_section` - on statics and functions, this specifies the section of the
  object file that this item's contents will be placed into.
- `no_mangle` - on any item, do not apply the standard name mangling. Set the
  symbol for this item to its identifier.

### Deprecation

The `deprecated` attribute marks an item as deprecated. It has two optional
fields, `since` and `note`.

- `since` expects a version number, as in `#[deprecated(since = "1.4.1")]`
    - `rustc` doesn't know anything about versions, but external tools like
      `clippy` may check the validity of this field.
- `note` is a free text field, allowing you to provide an explanation about
  the deprecation and preferred alternatives.

Only [public items](visibility-and-privacy.html) can be given the
`#[deprecated]` attribute. `#[deprecated]` on a module is inherited by all
child items of that module.

`rustc` will issue warnings on usage of `#[deprecated]` items. `rustdoc` will
show item deprecation, including the `since` version and `note`, if available.

Here's an example.

```rust
#[deprecated(since = "5.2", note = "foo was rarely used. Users should instead use bar")]
pub fn foo() {}

pub fn bar() {}
```

The [RFC][1270-deprecation.md] contains motivations and more details.

[1270-deprecation.md]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1270-deprecation.md

### Documentation

The `doc` attribute is used to document items and fields. [Doc comments]
are transformed into `doc` attributes.

See [The Rustdoc Book] for reference material on this attribute.

### `path`

The `path` attribute says where a [module]'s source file is. See [modules] for
more information.

### Preludes

The [prelude] behavior can be modified with attributes. The [`no_std`] attribute
changes the prelude to the core prelude while the [`no_implicit_prelude`]
prevents the prelude from being added to the module.

### Testing

The compiler comes with a default test framework. It works by attributing
functions with the `test` attribute. These functions are only compiled when
compiling with the test harness. Like [main], functions annotated with this
attribute must take no arguments, must not declare any
[trait or lifetime bounds], must not have any [where clauses], and its return
type must be one of the following:

* `()`
* `Result<(), E> where E: Error`
<!-- * `!` -->
<!-- * Result<!, E> where E: Error` -->

> Note: The implementation of which return types are allowed is determined by
> the unstable [`Termination`] trait.

<!-- If the previous section needs updating (from "must take no arguments"
  onwards, also update it in the crates-and-source-files.md file -->

> Note: The test harness is ran by passing the `--test` argument to `rustc` or
> using `cargo test`.

Tests that return `()` pass as long as they terminate and do not panic. Tests
that return a `Result` pass as long as they return `Ok(())`. Tests that do not
terminate neither pass nor fail.

A function annotated with the `test` attribute can also be annotated with the
`ignore` attribute. The *`ignore` attribute* tells the test harness to not
execute that function as a test. It will still only be compiled when compiling
with the test harness.

A function annotated with the `test` attribute that returns `()` can also be
annotated with the `should_panic` attribute. The *`should_panic` attribute*
makes the test only pass if it actually panics.

### Conditional compilation

The `cfg` and `cfg_attr` attributes control conditional compilation of [items]
and attributes. See the [conditional compilation] section for reference material
on these attributes.

### Lint check attributes

A lint check names a potentially undesirable coding pattern, such as
unreachable code or omitted documentation, for the static entity to which the
attribute applies.

For any lint check `C`:

* `allow(C)` overrides the check for `C` so that violations will go
   unreported,
* `deny(C)` signals an error after encountering a violation of `C`,
* `forbid(C)` is the same as `deny(C)`, but also forbids changing the lint
   level afterwards,
* `warn(C)` warns about violations of `C` but continues compilation.

The lint checks supported by the compiler can be found via `rustc -W help`,
along with their default settings.  [Compiler
plugins][unstable book plugin] can provide additional lint checks.

```rust
pub mod m1 {
    // Missing documentation is ignored here
    #[allow(missing_docs)]
    pub fn undocumented_one() -> i32 { 1 }

    // Missing documentation signals a warning here
    #[warn(missing_docs)]
    pub fn undocumented_too() -> i32 { 2 }

    // Missing documentation signals an error here
    #[deny(missing_docs)]
    pub fn undocumented_end() -> i32 { 3 }
}
```

This example shows how one can use `allow` and `warn` to toggle a particular
check on and off:

```rust
#[warn(missing_docs)]
pub mod m2{
    #[allow(missing_docs)]
    pub mod nested {
        // Missing documentation is ignored here
        pub fn undocumented_one() -> i32 { 1 }

        // Missing documentation signals a warning here,
        // despite the allow above.
        #[warn(missing_docs)]
        pub fn undocumented_two() -> i32 { 2 }
    }

    // Missing documentation signals a warning here
    pub fn undocumented_too() -> i32 { 3 }
}
```

This example shows how one can use `forbid` to disallow uses of `allow` for
that lint check:

```rust,compile_fail
#[forbid(missing_docs)]
pub mod m3 {
    // Attempting to toggle warning signals an error here
    #[allow(missing_docs)]
    /// Returns 2.
    pub fn undocumented_too() -> i32 { 2 }
}
```

#### Tool lint attributes

Tool lints let you use scoped lints, to `allow`, `warn`, `deny` or `forbid` lints of
certain tools.

Currently `clippy` is the only available lint tool.

They only get checked when the associated tool is active, so if you try to use an `allow` attribute for a nonexistent tool lint, the compiler will not warn about the nonexistent lint until you use the tool.

Otherwise, they work just like regular lint attributes:

```rust
// set the entire `pedantic` clippy lint group to warn
#![warn(clippy::pedantic)]
// silence warnings from the `filter_map` clippy lint
#![allow(clippy::filter_map)]

fn main() {
    // ...
}

// silence the `cmp_nan` clippy lint just for this function
#[allow(clippy::cmp_nan)]
fn foo() {
    // ...
}
```

#### `must_use`

The `must_use` attribute can be used on user-defined composite types
([`struct`s][struct], [`enum`s][enum], and [`union`s][union]) and [functions].

When used on user-defined composite types, if the [expression] of an
[expression statement] has that type, then the `unused_must_use` lint is
violated.

```rust
#[must_use]
struct MustUse {
  // some fields
}

# impl MustUse {
#   fn new() -> MustUse { MustUse {} }
# }
#
fn main() {
  // Violates the `unused_must_use` lint.
  MustUse::new();
}
```

When used on a function, if the [expression] of an
[expression statement] is a [call expression] to that function, then the
`unused_must_use` lint is violated. The exceptions to this is if the return type
of the function is `()`, `!`, or a [zero-variant enum], in which case the
attribute does nothing.

```rust
#[must_use]
fn five() -> i32 { 5i32 }

fn main() {
  // Violates the unused_must_use lint.
  five();
}
```

When used on a function in a trait declaration, then the behavior also applies
when the call expression is a function from an implementation of the trait.

```rust
trait Trait {
  #[must_use]
  fn use_me(&self) -> i32;
}

impl Trait for i32 {
  fn use_me(&self) -> i32 { 0i32 }
}

fn main() {
  // Violates the `unused_must_use` lint.
  5i32.use_me();
}
```

When used on a function in an implementation, the attribute does nothing.

> Note: Trivial no-op expressions containing the value will not violate the
> lint. Examples include wrapping the value in a type that does not implement
> [`Drop`] and then not using that type and being the final expression of a
> [block expression] that is not used.
>
> ```rust
> #[must_use]
> fn five() -> i32 { 5i32 }
>
> fn main() {
>   // None of these violate the unused_must_use lint.
>   (five(),);
>   Some(five());
>   { five() };
>   if true { five() } else { 0i32 };
>   match true {
>     _ => five()
>   };
> }
> ```

> Note: It is idiomatic to use a [let statement] with a pattern of `_`
> when a must-used value is purposely discarded.
>
> ```rust
> #[must_use]
> fn five() -> i32 { 5i32 }
>
> fn main() {
>   // Does not violate the unused_must_use lint.
>   let _ = five();
> }
> ```

The `must_use` attribute may also include a message by using
`#[must_use = "message"]`. The message will be given alongside the warning.

### Optimization Hints

The `cold` and `inline` attributes give suggestions to the compiler to compile
your code in a way that may be faster than what it would do without the hint.
The attributes are only suggestions, and the compiler may choose to ignore it.

Both attributes can be used on closures, [functions] and function prototypes,
although they do not do anything on function prototypes. When applied to a
function in a [trait], they apply only to that function when used as a default
function for a trait implementation and not to all trait implementations.

#### `inline` Attribute

The *`inline` attribute* suggests to the compiler that it should place a copy of
the attributed function in the caller, rather than generating code to call the
function where it is defined.

> ***Note***: The compiler automatically inlines functions based on internal
> heuristics. Incorrectly inlining functions can actually make the program
> slower, so this attribute should be used with care.

There are three ways of using the inline attribute:

* `#[inline]` hints the compiler to perform an inline expansion.
* `#[inline(always)]` asks the compiler to always perform an inline expansion.
* `#[inline(never)]` asks the compiler to never perform an inline expansion.

#### `cold` Attribute

The *`cold` attribute* suggests to the compiler that the attributed function or
closure is unlikely to be called.

### `derive`

The `derive` attribute allows certain traits to be automatically implemented
for data structures. For example, the following will create an `impl` for the
`PartialEq` and `Clone` traits for `Foo`, and the type parameter `T` will be given
the `PartialEq` or `Clone` constraints for the appropriate `impl`:

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Clone)]
struct Foo<T> {
    a: i32,
    b: T,
}
```

The generated `impl` for `PartialEq` is equivalent to

```rust
# struct Foo<T> { a: i32, b: T }
impl<T: PartialEq> PartialEq for Foo<T> {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Foo<T>) -> bool {
        self.a == other.a && self.b == other.b
    }

    fn ne(&self, other: &Foo<T>) -> bool {
        self.a != other.a || self.b != other.b
    }
}
```

You can implement `derive` for your own traits through [procedural macros].

## Tool attributes

The compiler may allow attributes for external tools where each tool resides
in its own namespace. The first segment of the attribute path is the name of
the tool, with one or more additional segments whose interpretation is up to
the tool.

When a tool is not in use, the tool's attributes are accepted without a
warning. When the tool is in use, the tool is responsible for processing and
interpretation of its attributes.

Tool attributes are not available if the [`no_implicit_prelude`] attribute is
used.

```rust
// Tells the rustfmt tool to not format the following element.
#[rustfmt::skip]
struct S {
}

// Controls the "cyclomatic complexity" threshold for the clippy tool.
#[clippy::cyclomatic_complexity = "100"]
pub fn f() {}
```

> Note: `rustc` currently recognizes the tools "clippy" and "rustfmt".
